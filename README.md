# Python Optimization Tips üöÄ

Exploring simple yet powerful Python optimization techniques through practical examples. This repository focuses on demonstrating how small changes in code structure and data structure choices can lead to significant performance improvements.

## Why This Repository?

In Python development, especially in data processing and backend systems, performance optimization is crucial. However, many developers jump into complex solutions before considering simple optimizations. This repository shows how basic Python features and proper data structure choices can significantly improve performance.

## Purpose

- Demonstrate practical optimization techniques
- Compare different approaches with actual metrics
- Provide reusable code examples
- Show the impact of data structure choices
- Help developers make better optimization decisions

## Current Examples

### 1. List Comprehension vs Loop
Converting a traditional loop to list comprehension for creating a list of squared even numbers.

**Key Learning Points:**
- List comprehension is not just more readable
- Reduces memory operations
- Leverages Python's internal optimizations
- 10% performance improvement

### 2. Set vs List Lookup
Comparing lookup performance between list and set data structures.

**Key Learning Points:**
- Importance of choosing the right data structure
- Time complexity impact (O(n) vs O(1))
- Memory trade-offs for better performance
- 98% performance improvement

## Coming Soon üîú

Planning to add more optimization examples including:
1. String Concatenation Methods
2. Generator vs List
3. Built-in Functions Performance
4. Memory Optimization Techniques
5. Multi-threading vs Multi-processing
6. NumPy Array Operations
7. Dictionary Performance Tips

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shahinabdi/python-optimization-tips.git
```
2. Run the tests:
```bash
python tests/test_list_optimization.py
python tests/test_lookup_optimization.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- No external dependencies
